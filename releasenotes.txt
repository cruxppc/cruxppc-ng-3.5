Release Notes for CRUX PPC 3.5 Alpha release 

  Introduction

   This page discusses the relevant changes introduced in CRUX PPC 3.5.

 Supported machines:
 Apple 32bit "NewWorld" G4 (G4 only at this time, G3 support will be later)

 Other machines which use the G3, G4, or 60X PowerPC processors may be 
 compatible with CRUX PPC 3.5 but are untested. Use on non-MAC machines will 
 likely require the user to improvise installation (and at the least
 will require the user to obtain/build a kernel for their machine).

 Non supported machines:
 64bit PowerPC.

  Toolchain updates

   CRUX PPC 3.5 includes glibc 2.28, gcc 8.3.0 and binutils 2.32 .

  Kernel

   Linux-4.19.24

  Important changes

   CRUX PPC 3.5 is a new port of CRUX to the PowerPC.  There is no support
   for upgrading from any earlier CRUX PPC releases to 3.5.  

  Miscellaneous notes

   Please be sure you are using the  latest version of firmware for your  own
   machine.  If you are converting a MACOS machine to a Linux only machine, be 
   aware that Linux does not provide the firmware update tools and so it is 
   important to update the firmware before wiping out MACOS.

  Known issues

   CRUX PPC does not provide .signature checking on the ppc specific packages.

   It is not uncommon for the footprints to mismatch when building on powerpc.
   The package build utilities provide an option to ignore footprints.  Also
   /etc/prt-get.conf can be adjusted to ignore footprints by default.

   The contents of core-ppc, opt-ppc, and xorg-ppc are not automatically
   updated when 'ports -u' is run.  For now, the user will have to 
   manually pull their contents from this repository and update their
   system with any changes.

   On some monitors, the left most characters are not visible.  Until this
   is solved, a workaround is to install the xorg server packages and then
   run 'startx'.  The xorg server provides a rudimentary set of windows
   and the whole output will be visible.

   The midori browser does not seem to function properly with https
   connections (on ppc only, works fine on x86..).  Until this is solved, 
   it is best to not spend the (long) time needed to build it and it's
   dependency chain.

   All of the applicable core packages have been built on powerpc but 
   only a subset of opt and xorg packages have been built with CRUX PPC.
   Some of the opt and xorg packages have not been built at all, and others 
   have had to be downreved to build.   Be aware that opt and xorg packages 
   particularly are a work in progress for CRUX PPC and that you may be
   the very first person building a particular opt or xorg package in
   CRUXPPC 3.5.

   The mesa3d package install may fail due to an overlap with files from
   another package.   If mesa is not desired, then just ignore the error
   Otherwise, after install is complete Use the -f option to pkgadd to 
   force the installation of mesa.
 
  Tips

   Package build times can be quite long even on faster powerpc machines.
   Allow for some hours (maybe days on slower machines) when building 
   big packages.  Ensure that your machine has the maximum RAM that it
   can support.   

   For now, there is no pre-built browser provided.   The shortest path
   to a (somewhat functional) gui browser on CRUX-PPC is the "dillo" browser. 
   The "dillo" port is not present in 3.5 but previously existed and
   has been adjusted for 3.5.   It can be found under "misc".

   The lynx or links browser can also be installed quickly if a text based
   browser is sufficient for the users needs.
