Release Notes for CRUX PPC 3.5 Alpha release 
01/06/2020

  Introduction

   This page discusses the relevant changes introduced in CRUX PPC 3.5.

 Supported machines:

 Apple 32bit "NewWorld" G4 and (in theory) G3 machines are supported.  In 
practice however, most of building and testing of CRUX PPC 3.5 is performed
on G4 machines, and G3 is only minimally tested.

 In this Alpha release, machines which have an NVIDIA graphics card will
 not function well.   An easy, but ugly, workaround can be performed
 which will get NVIDIA machines up to a command line prompt.  So, it can
 be used on such machines  but if you have a machine with an NVIDIA card, 
 it may be better off waiting for a fix in a later release.   Machines with
 the ATI Rage video cards are not yet functioning with a GUI interface but
 do support a command line interface.

 Non Apple PPC machines which use the G3, G4, or 60X PowerPC processors may be 
 compatible with CRUX PPC 3.5 but are untested. Use on non-MAC machines will 
 likely require the user to improvise installation (and at the least
 will require the user to obtain/build a kernel for their machine).

 This release is built on a G4 machine with CFLAGS set such that the
 build releases should also function on G3 machines.  In reality however,
 in a few of the packages, the compiler inserts G4 specific instructions 
 which will cause an illegal instruction exception when used on a G3 machine.
 The user can rebuild such packages and they should function properly 
 once rebuilt on a G3.

 Non supported machines:
 64bit PowerPC.

  Toolchain updates

   CRUX PPC 3.5 includes glibc 2.28, gcc 8.3.0 and binutils 2.32 .

  Kernel

   Linux-4.19.24

  Important changes

   CRUX PPC 3.5 is a new port of CRUX to the PowerPC.  There is no support
   for upgrading from any earlier CRUX PPC releases to 3.5.  Likewise, 
   future CRUX PPC releases will not likely support upgrading from this
   alpha release, so make notes of any local configuration changes made so
   that they can be remade when installing later CEUX PPC releases.

  Miscellaneous notes

   Please be sure you are using the  latest version of firmware for your  own
   machine.  If you are converting a MACOS machine to a Linux only machine, be 
   aware that Linux does not provide the firmware update tools and so it is 
   important to update the firmware before wiping out MACOS.

  Known issues

   CRUX PPC does not provide .signature checking on the ppc specific packages.
   And in fact, in this Alpha release, not even md5sum checking.

   The CRUXPPC 3.5 install CD for this Alpha release is a remastered 2.7 
   install CD.  The various install utilities on the CD remain at 2.7 
   versions but the packages that are installed to the target system
   have been updated to 3.5 versions.    This does not cause any known problems
   but is something the user should be aware of.  Future work will update
   the install CD to be entirely based on 3.5 versions.

   It is not uncommon for the footprints to mismatch when building on powerpc.
   The package build utilities provide an option to ignore footprints.  Also
   /etc/prt-get.conf can be adjusted to ignore footprints by default.   A
   footprint mismatch is not necessarily indicative of an actual problem in the
   build.

   The contents of /usr/ports/core-ppc, opt-ppc, xorg-ppc, and contrib-ppc
   are not automatically updated when 'ports -u' is run.  For now, the 
   user will have to manually pull the contents from this repository 
   and update their /usr/ports/*-ppc directory with any changes.

   On some monitors, the left most characters are not visible.  Until this
   is solved, a workaround is to install the xorg server packages and then
   run 'startx'.  The xorg server provides a rudimentary set of windows
   and the whole output will be visible.   Enabling ssh access to the 
   machine and using it to access the machine is also a workaround.

   The midori browser does not seem to function properly with https
   connections (on ppc only, works fine on x86..).  Until this is solved, 
   it is best to not spend the (long) time needed to build it and it's
   dependency chain.  netsurf is provided on the install CD and can be
   used for basic web browsing until a better browser is supported.

   All of the applicable core packages have been built on powerpc but 
   only a subset of opt and xorg packages have been built with CRUX PPC.
   Some of the opt and xorg packages have not been built at all, and others 
   have had to be downreved to build.   Be aware that opt and xorg packages 
   particularly are a work in progress for CRUX PPC and that you may be
   the very first person building a particular opt or xorg package in
   CRUXPPC 3.5.  Likewise, most contrib ports have not been tried in 
   CRUX PPC.

   When using CRUX PPC on G3 hardware a few packages may need to be
   rebuilt natively on the G3 machine in order to function properly.
   If a package causes illegal instruction exceptions, it may need
   to be rebuilt on the G3 machine to function properly.

  Tips

   Package build times can be quite long even on faster powerpc machines.
   Allow for some hours (maybe days on slower machines) when building 
   big packages.  Ensure that your machine has the maximum RAM that it
   can support to help reduce build times.

   For now, netsurf is the browser installed.  Firefox may be  installed
   from the "extras" packages but is somewhat sluggish even on higher end 
   PowerPC machines.   netsurf lacks some functionality found in other 
   browsers but works for most websites and performance is decent.

   The lynx or links browser can also be installed quickly if a text based
   browser is sufficient for the users needs.
