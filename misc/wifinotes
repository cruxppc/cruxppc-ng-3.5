To bringup wifi in cruxppc:

1) If using a USB wifi adapter, install the linux-firmware package and
   depending on the adapter, you may need to rebuild kernel with support
   for that device enabled.
   If using builtin wifi adapter, linux-firmware should not be needed.
   Reboot after installing linux-firmware package.

2) Add password protected entries to /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf by using
   wpa_passphrase like so:

  "wpa_passphrase yourssidname yourwifipassword >>/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf"


   Manually add wpa_supplicant.conf entry for non password wifi like so:

   network={
	ssid="CoffeeShop_Public_WIFI"
        key_mgmt=NONE
   }
   

3) Modify the /etc/rc.d/wlan startup script as needed.  
   Specifically change the defintion of "DEV" to the
   name of appropriate interface.   The builtin wifi on ppc 
   machines is normally named "wlan0".  e.g. change:

   DEV=wlan0


4) Add wlan to /etc/rc.conf to enable auto startup of wifi
   at boot.   It may display an ERROR during startup but should
   complete connection shortly after startup is complete.

   Alternatively, wifi can be brought up manually by running
   "/etc/rc.d/wlan start".


For reference README file from wpa_supplicant follows.   It contains
useful information:

README for wpa_supplicant


REQUIREMENTS

Kernel driver for your wireless card, e.g. ndiswrapper or ipw2100. 
See the wpa_supplicant homepage for supported drivers.


PRE-INSTALL


POST-INSTALL

1. Create a network setup for wpa_supplicant:

   wpa_passphrase <ssid> <your_secret> >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

   See the sample configuration file wpa_supplicant.conf in the
   sources for a complete description of the available options 
   for wpa_supplicant. 

2. Change your wlan start script to use wpa_supplicant.

   Following an example for the centrino ipw2100 driver, no need 
   to do anything with iwconfig:

   /sbin/modprobe ipw2100
   /sbin/ifconfig eth1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask 255.255.255.xxx
   /sbin/route add default gw xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
   /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -B -Dnl80211 -ieth1 -c/etc/wpa.conf

   Note: the above configuration makes use of the generic nl80211
         wpa_supplicant driver, which is the preferred nowadays 
         and supersedes the wext (wireless extensions) driver.

PRECAUTION

As off version 0.6.8 the -w option of wpa_supplicant was removed.
See the ChangeLog for more infos. This may cause troubles because
using the -w option was the recommend way to start wpa_supplicant
until version 0.6.
