To bringup wifi in cruxppc:

1) If needed, install linux-firmware package.  This should
   not be needed if using builtin ppc machine wifi and
   also using the builtin firmware.
2) Modify the /etc/rc.d/wlan startup script as needed.  
   Specifically change the defintion of "DEV" to the
   name of appropriate interface.   The builtin wifi on ppc 
   machines is normally named "wlan0"
3) Add wlan to /etc/rc.conf to enable auto startup of wifi
   at boot.   It may display an ERROR during startup but should
   complete connection shortly after startup is complete.


For reference README file from wpa_supplicant follows.   It contains
useful information:

README for wpa_supplicant


REQUIREMENTS

Kernel driver for your wireless card, e.g. ndiswrapper or ipw2100. 
See the wpa_supplicant homepage for supported drivers.


PRE-INSTALL


POST-INSTALL

1. Create a network setup for wpa_supplicant:

   wpa_passphrase <ssid> <your_secret> >> /etc/wpa.conf

   See the sample configuration file wpa_supplicant.conf in the
   sources for a complete description of the available options 
   for wpa_supplicant. 

2. Change your wlan start script to use wpa_supplicant.

   Following an example for the centrino ipw2100 driver, no need 
   to do anything with iwconfig:

   /sbin/modprobe ipw2100
   /sbin/ifconfig eth1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx netmask 255.255.255.xxx
   /sbin/route add default gw xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
   /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant -B -Dnl80211 -ieth1 -c/etc/wpa.conf

   Note: the above configuration makes use of the generic nl80211
         wpa_supplicant driver, which is the preferred nowadays 
         and supersedes the wext (wireless extensions) driver.

PRECAUTION

As off version 0.6.8 the -w option of wpa_supplicant was removed.
See the ChangeLog for more infos. This may cause troubles because
using the -w option was the recommend way to start wpa_supplicant
until version 0.6.
