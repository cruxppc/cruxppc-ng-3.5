# Description: Autoconf macros and scripts to augment app build systems
# URL: https://git.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-dev-tools/tree/README
# Maintainer: cruxppc at gmail dot com
# Depends on: glib
# Xfce git (https://git.xfce.org/) group: xfce
# Note:  This port is depended upon by all ports in all xfce_?.?? collections
#        (explicitly only by tumbler) for purposes of installing the associated
#        CRUX package files into CRUX systems whether they are built locally or
#        just pkgadded using CRUX package files built elsewhere.  As this port's
#        Xfce.org tools are needed only for building the packages, it might appear
#        requiring this port on pkgadd-only systems causes packages to be installed
#        that are build-only requirements. However, this package does not depend on
#        any packages not automatically installed or not needed to run Xfce on such
#        systems, so its bloat factor for pkgadd-only installs is negligible.
#
#        The non-Xfce.org script installed is called by every port via its
#        pre-install script to ensure no software maintenance is attempted for
#        xfce_?.?? ports that would mix packages of different XFce releases or in
#        situations where non-xfce_?.?? ports have been installed when one or more
#        Xfce_?.?? ports had already been installed.

  # release preparatory to installing a newer stable release in its place (because
  # running this script deletes the script, the first thing it does is copy itself
  # to the /root directory and execs the copy):
