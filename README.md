## CRUX 3.5 port to powerpc (32bit)

  This repository contains a port of CRUX Linux 3.5 to the PowerPC architecture (32 bit only).   

  Note that this project is not a part of, nor sponsored, nor endorsed by the mainline (X86) CRUX project.  The CRUXPPC project is NOT supported by the mainline CRUX
development team.   If you are using CRUX-PPC and run into problems, please DO NOT ask questions of, or raise bug reports against, the mainline CRUX project.  

  CRUX is a lightweight Linux distribution and CRUX PPC is an even lighter weight port of CRUX to the PowerPC architecture.   CRUX provides 
  a small set of prebuilt packages which are sufficient to get started with but a completed CRUX PPC system will likely require the user to
  build and add a number of additional packages. If you are 
  looking for a turn key Linux distro for your hardware with many prebuilt packages available, CRUX is probably not what you are looking for.   
  
  CRUX provides a minimal starting root filesystem and the user then builds and adds additional packages as they desire.   CRUX is a build it yourself and 
  figure it out yourself kind of distribution.   CRUX users will need to be experienced with the command line, manually editing configuration files,
  building packages, etc.   If you desire point and click system maintenance, CRUX is not what you are looking for.

  CRUX-PPC goal is to supports 32bit PowerPC G3 and G4.   It does not support 64bit PowerPC (G5) at this time.   
There are still a fair number of Linux distributions supporting G5 machines but distros 
supporting 32bit PowerPC are getting scarce.  Hence, for now at least, CRUX-PPC efforts are focused on the 32bit PowerPC machines.   

  At the current time CRUX-PPC does not run properly on G3 systems.   Until this issue is resolved, CRUX-PPC should only be used with
G4 machines.

  This project is not a continuation of the (now defunct) CRUX-PPC project which existed previously (until 2012 or so).   This project is a 
  new port of CRUX-3.5 to the PowerPC.  Although similarities exist and pieces from the previous CRUX-PPC may be reused in this project, this is a
  fresh port of CRUX to the PowerPC and backwards compatibility with the previous CRUX PPC is not a goal of this project.

  crux ppc 3.5 is a work in progress.  It still has a lot of rough edges.
If you are already familiar with CRUX or manual installation and configuration
of a Linux sytem, then you should be able to work through the rough spots.
As time passes, the rough edges will be smoothed out but as of right now,
there may be issues that the user will have to figure out and work through.

### Project goals:

   Create a port of CRUX to the Apple PowerPC 32 bit machines.   

   Provide the same functionality for PowerPC as is provide by mainline Crux for x86 machines.   This will be done in stages.   The initial focus is
on providing a solid set of core packages.   Subsequent efforts will be towards building a set of prebuilt packages from opt and xorg that are
equivalent to what is on the Crux install ISO.   Later stages will work on creating a CRUX PPC installation CD and validation of additional 
packages from opt, xorg and contrib.

   Crux PPC will generally be kept consistent with Crux mainline as much 
as possible.   Changes certainly are required for the PowerPC but  
differences between Crux PPC and Crux mainline will be minimized.

### Contents:

  This repository provides the crux core, opt and xorg ports that are
known to require changes to work for the powerpc.  These can be found 
in the 'core-ppc', 'opt-ppc' and 'xorg-ppc' directories (and maybe
contrib-ppc later..).  Ports which are unchanged for powerpc are not 
included in this repository but instead are sourced from the main (x86/64) crux project.

  This repository provides release notes, an installation handbook
and various notes and materials related to crux ppc development.

  The 'releases' section of this repository provides a starter 
crux ppc 3.5 root filesystem.  This rootfs is the seed from which a user
grows the remainder of their crux system.   As time passes, additional pre-built
packabges from opt, xorg and contrib may also be added to the releases
section of this repository.


### Usage overview:


  The handbook provides details of the CRUXPPC install process.  Essentially,
  download the CD iso file, burn a CD and boot it.   

  The user will may need to install a number of additional packages beyond what
  is provided by the install CD to have a crux system that meets their needs.

  Selected prebuilt packages from "opt", "xorg" and maybe "contrib" 
  may be found in the releases area.   These are optional, not required,
  packages, typically requiring a long build time and are provided to help 
  speed up the creation of the final CRUX PPC system.

  A more detailed description of installing and configuring CRUX PPC can be
  found in the handbook and release notes.
