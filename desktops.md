# Desktops

Like mainline crux, the crux-ppc install CD does not provide a desktop.   THe x-server is provided but not a desktop.

The user selects a desktop and adds it themselves.  

A google search will find a number of repositories that support building a desktop for crux.   Some of them work, some don't.   


## LXDE

A repository for adding a simple LXDE desktop can be found under 'experimental'.   LXDE is a lightweight desktop and
works well if all you need is something simple.   An error message of "Could not connect.." initially pops up during startup
but it seems benign and also occurs on x86 CRUX so is something to fix but not crucial.

## XFCE

A snapshot of an XFCE repository can be found under experimental.   XFCE has more stuff than LXDE but is still fairly
lightweight.    The snapshot is not updated though, and it might be better to use the on-line repository to get the 
latest updates.

## Other desktop

In theory, you should be able to add other desktops but I haven't tried anything other than LXDE and XFCE.
